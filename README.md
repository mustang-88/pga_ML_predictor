# pga_ML_predictor

This is a modified condensed version of a forecasting application for PGA Golf to predict tournament winners based on event just to showcase joins/pandas/webscraping/ML etc. The real version is offline in some unknown location.

Look for the live WebApp version coming soon in 2022 via django
